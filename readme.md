# LA-ICPMS measurements of elemental concentration from floatglass

This dataset consists of elemental concentration from floatglass as obtained with LA-ICPMS.
The measurements are from reference glass from casework, collected in the past 10 years or so. 

The dataset consists of two parts: 	
1. the data used for training the two-level model. It consists of 3 replicated measurements per glass particle. 
2. the validation data, consisting of five replicates per glass particle, divided in ‘duplos’ and ‘triplos’ for cross-comparison. 

Each particle is from a different reference window. The elemental concentrations are on a log_10 basis, and normalized to Si.
